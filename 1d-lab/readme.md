It's never too early to think about your Web Developer Portfolio! This won't be the final versions, so try not to spend too much time styling this to look pretty. The purpose is to get you thinking about the following:

- A 1 paragraph career summary
- A set of projects you've created (Include the projects created in class!)

By the end of this course, you will be creating your portfolio in React and deploying it to the web so that you can simply send people the link to your portfolio. For now, this exercise will give you practice on everything we learned in this unit, and give you an basic understanding on what a website takes to be fully functional.

## Tasks:

- Import the HTTP and FS modules
- Create a server object
- Create custom HTML files
- - `localhost:3000/` Home Page, Include an image of yourself and a short introduction
- - `localhost:3000/projects` Include screenshots of previously built projects, and a short description of each
- - 404 HTML page, covers any other URL extentions. Include a link back to the home page
- IF you use local Javascript, it gets written locally on the HTML files in the tag `<script src="" async defer></script>`
- CSS gets written locally on the HTML files in the `<style>`
- Set up a response to each HTML file on the server
- Set up a nav bar on each HTML file to navigate between pages

The following bonuses may require you to research how to do this on your own.

## Bonus:

Add a response to the following URL:

- - `localhost:3000/time` Include a digital clock that shows your current local time
- Style it to be responsive to screen size (Desktop, Mobile)
- Create a footer on each web page with links to your Github and LinkedIn
