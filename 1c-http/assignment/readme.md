As your Web Developer skills begin to grow, word on the street is that you can serve various kinds of data at different URL extensions. It's time to flex your skills with a new API! For each of the following URL extensions, follow their instructions:

First, create a file called `index.js`. This is the file you'll be working on.

URL extension: `localhost:3000/jokes`

Select a random joke from the following data, and send it as a response to `localhost:3000/jokes`.

Jokes:

```js
[
  "What’s the pirate’s favorite letter? The 'C.'",
  "How do you make a squid laugh? Give it ten-tickles.",
  "What’s the best way to make an egg roll? Push it.",
  "What did one eye say to the other? Between us, something smells.",
  "When does a dad joke become a dad joke? When it becomes apparent.",
  "Why did the leaf go to the doctor? It had a bad fall.",
  "A bossy man walked into a bar, then ordered everyone a round.",
  "I’m not a hard drinker. I actually find it pretty easy.",
  "Did you hear about the tree that went into banking? It started its own branch.",
  "How does a lumberjack know how many trees he’s cut down? He keeps a log.",
  "Why do barbers make good drivers? They know a lot of short cuts.",
  "I’d tell you a pizza joke, but it’s probably too cheesy.",
  "Did you hear about the kidnapping? They woke her up.",
];
```
